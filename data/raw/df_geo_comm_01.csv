The US spends tremendous amounts on the military, and this conflict hasn't changed that.  If anything, the insight gained is considered tremendously valuable in its own right.  The US can make detailed observations of Russian tactics and true capabilities, and tweak its own technology after real life use.  The small dent in the US budget is easily paid for in terms of defense, by this valuable information.

Additionally the US and Russia have both been distancing themselves from arms control for years now.  The trend was already there, and Putin showed no signs of changing his tune even before the invasion.  

US-Russian relations have been bad for years now, even boot-licker Trump couldn't meaningfully change that.  The west has always been suspicious of Putin, and his constant acts of aggression and meddling did nothing to quell those feelings.

In terms of economic damage, yes there is some, but even if peace broke out tomorrow, Europe is still hard on course to ween itself off of Russian fuel, and Ukraine is already severely damaged.  At this point, it is less a question of how much damage gas been done, and more of how quickly they can rebuild.

Barring regime change, the likely pathways forward given current Ukrainian, U.S. and allied policies are either Russian escalation, as noted above, or a conflict of indefinite duration. A protracted war could benefit Washington to the extent that it weakens Moscow and forces it to pare back its ambitions elsewhere. But a war that drags on would also have significant downsides for the United States. It would continue to eat up military and financial resources as well as the time and energy of U.S. policymakers, diminishing Washington’s ability to prioritize long-term strategic competition with China. A protracted conflict would likely also sustain the deep freeze in U.S.-Russian relations, potentially jeopardizing cooperation between Washington and Moscow on issues of global importance, such as arms control.  
A long war would also disrupt the global economy. The United States’ most important trading partners and allies in Europe would be the hardest hit, mainly because of higher energy prices. And, of course, the country that would suffer the most—in terms of lives lost, infrastructure destroyed, and economic devastation—is Ukraine. Even a conflict that continues at a lower level of intensity would disrupt the economy and scare off investment, complicating the country’s economic recovery.  
In an op-ed in The New York Times in May, Biden wrote that U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was intended to put the country’s leaders in “in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.” Quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he wrote that “ultimately this war ‘will only definitively end through diplomacy.’” Five months later, that diplomacy has yet to materialize—a fact for which Russia bears primary responsibility.

&gt; Among the necessary reforms, the Chancellor suggested a ""gradual"" transition away from unanimity, a strict requirement that still applies to select areas of work, such as foreign policy and taxation, and that often bogs down collective action at the EU level.

Federalisation is a fairly meaningless gesture unless it leads to a unified armed forces and the ability to both tax and redistribute funds around the EU. For a number of reasons I think this is quite unlikely. Stronger EU armed forces can work well under a USA umbrella due America being the clear commanding power while the EU forces can operate within that framework. But I struggle to believe that the militaries of France/Germany/Poland/Italy/Spain could be placed under federal control at the EU level. And this is before getting to discussing how this would look after the potential ascension of Turkey and Ukraine etc. 

Noone has been able to successfully unite/dominate Europe since the Roman Empire literally millennia ago.

UK's industrial power and economic hegemony are long gone. But the average english totally refuse to believe in it. And they chose to go to Brexit. I've written a post in which I gave my humble opnion about the economic growth of the main economies, and my perspective on that of the UK isn't positive:

UK, stagnation, 6.0. Yes, I think UK's economic outlook is clearly worse than that of France or EU in general. Its FDI is now below that of France, just a little above that of Italy. GDP still not recovered to the pre-covid level, trading the same, politically it's been a big mess, industrially UK is much weaker than France/Germany. Trading and service are the backbone of the UK economy, yet they chose to isolate themselves from the EU, the single biggest economic and trading bloc at their doorstep. And they've failed to get some favorable trading terms with the US. If it were still within the EU, I'd put easily 8.0 to it. But now it no longer enjoys the EU single market, no longer receives investments from companies all around the world wanting to do business in EU, and so on. I think it's set to become the next sick man of Europe, like what Italy has been

[],False,,theatlantic,,,,[],,,,text,t2_15htj3oj,False,False,"&gt;Barbados, the easternmost stretch of land in the Caribbean Sea, is a pear-shaped island surrounded by a dense network of bright coral. As you crisscross the island, gently sloped hills give way to mazes of sugarcane fields. The plantations that once controlled the sugar crop were some of the first outposts of British colonial control in all of the Americas. That history, dating back to when an English ship arrived in 1625, is not as distant as it may seem. Though Barbados gained its independence as a constitutional monarchy in 1966, only last year did the nation formally sever ties with Britain—removing Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and electing the nation’s first president in the process.  
&gt;  
&gt;As in any postcolonial place, the complexities of the past occupation are omnipresent if not entirely tangible. The stakes of shedding colonial ties are under the surface of nearly every debate in public and political life. That’s true in nations across the Caribbean, as well as former U.S. territories such as Hawaii. Still, Barbados is unusual even among nations once colonized by the British. I came to the island because I wanted to understand what had made it possible for the country previously nicknamed “Little England” to distance itself from the monarchy, and what that distance actually means. What I found was a rare and deliberate expression of public memory that is reshaping the way Barbadians understand their place in the world.

*The USA would have been delighted to avoid 9/11. Seriously, it was awful and massively warped the national psyche. Most of the bad stuff of the last 2 decades comes from that.*

If the Afghani Taliban regime and their terrorist puppets Al Qaedi had been stopped by a regional group like SCO, the USA would not have invaded Afghanistan (probably not Iraq either). There was no regional group like the African Union that was capable of anything like that in 2001, and UN blue helmets only work at policing peace agreements and protecting starvation aid. If SCO can actually keep stability and squash terrorism, that would be great. 

&gt;Also, with time, by eliminating mutual frictions, a collective security treaty can be a possibility because with cutting-edge technologies it would be hard for a single country to protect itself, so regional interests will be protected by doing that.

Also, on AFG stability, all SCO members have a unanimous agreement, bringing peace to it. The point being said here is that SCO has started engaging all regional countries and it will leave little space for the US to infiltrate into the region, as it did in Iraq, AFG, and other places previously, and make it politically and economically unstable. By solving conflicts and bringing mutual trust the region will become stable - with political stability comes economic prosperity.

 Just because someone lives in an urban area doesn't mean they are more ""liberal' in the Western sense.

 Historically Islam spread through trade, and cities were often the centers of Islamic learning. In many Muslim countries, cities tend to be more ""Islamic"" than rural areas. A good example is Indonesia and Central Asia. Samarkand was a center of Islamic learning, and it is one reason why Uzbeks are more orthodox than rural Kazakhs for example. 

One has to be very careful not to get caught in the Western dichotomy of rural = conservative, urban = liberal.  Even the concept of liberal/conservative is problematic when applied to other cultures. 

The Hijab protests actually started in the periphery (ie Iranian Kurdistan), because the victim was an Iranian Kurd.  This is a very good article describing the ethnic dimension of the protest.

This goes way back to Soviet times. Starting from Stalin overruling the lower council on keeping Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan, Kremlin has historically always had a better relationship with Azerbaijan than Armenia (if not de jure, then de facto). The Soviets repeatedly turned down Nagorno-Karabakh requests to be reassigned to the Armenian SSR. Even Gorbachev looked the other way when the Baku pogrom was going on (the Red Army only intervened right after it was completed). Yeltsin flat out allowed Azerbaijan to join CSTO in 1993 *during* a war between AZ/AR. 

Azerbaijan walked out of CSTO in 1999 after it started becoming wealthier and found a closer security partner in Turkey, but in all other ways Kremlin has continued to maintain a close relationship and even continues to sell arms *after* the 2020 war and this year's border skirmishes. Why so? Money. Thanks to Azerbaijani oil/gas reserves and a 3x higher population, this is a much more lucrative relationship than the one with Armenia. Russia gets pretty much nothing from helping Armenia, so it only does the bare minimum to avoid losing face totally.

Armenia has been stuck in the useless CSTO because it can't realistically get hard military help from the West either; it is landlocked, impoverished, and has alienated alternative benefactors by supporting Russia. However, it has recently started getting more sympathy, and now after the latest skirmish there are EU-led negotiations for a peace treaty between the leaders Pashinyan and Aliyev (who hadn't met face to face before).

My personal take is that democracies have an obligation to defend each other against aggressors. It sends a message to china that the US will act to defend its friendlies(at least, with a democrat in the White House, I am having a tough time gaging what GOP policy would be here, trump aside) which I think is important as they ramp up their aggression around Taiwan. It also shows America is still willing to be active abroad and assist in their interests, something which disappeared entirely under trump who had nothing but disdain for our alliances. 

Beyond that, degrading Russian capabilities is nothing but net benefits. It makes them a weaker ally to many of americas potential adversaries, including those in Asia and the Middle East. 

Finally, it’s also the moral thing to do, and it shows that America is still a force for good. You can’t use methods from the 19th century to wage a war from the 20th century. Genocide should be a no go. The US coming to Ukraine’s aid has helped rally democracies abroad and strengthen alliances and provide a shared sense of cause.

In the last couple of weeks, there have been a lot of discussions about Pelosi's Trip to Taiwan, and China's reaction to it.  What is largely absent from the discussion is the Philippines' predicament and its response.  While there have been several articles on the Philippines' response to the crisis, I will focus on  Susannah Patton's [What the Philippines has at stake in Taiwan.](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/what-philippines-has-stake-taiwan)  It's largely ignored in most discussions of the Taiwan Crisis but in reality, it's a critical player.

# SUMMARY

Outside of Taiwan itself and China itself, no other county will be impacted more than the Philippines, since Luzon is only 380 km from Taiwan. I would say depending on how the crisis unfolds, the Philippines could end up being impacted more than even China itself.

The Philippines Defense Secretary warned that it would lead to a humanitarian disaster and refugee crisis for the Philippines, pointing out the hundreds of thousands of refugees the Philippines took in from Vietnam in the 1970s.

Secondly, there are 200,000 Filipino workers in Taiwan, most of them domestic helpers or factory workers. There are already talks about preparing contingencies.

Thirdly, China gaining control of Taiwan would be a disaster for the Philippines' strategic interest in the South China Seas. A successful invasion will hinder the US's ability to assist the Philippines if they are threatened by China in the future.

Because of these reasons and the Philippines' long-standing ties with the US, it would allow US access to its bases.

&gt;Since July 2021, when Duterte finally announced he would not abrogate the VFA, US defence officials see the alliance on a “[very strong trajectory](https://www.rappler.com/nation/united-states-defense-official-sees-ties-with-philippines-on-a-very-strong-trajectory/)”. The two sides are finally making [progress in implementing the “Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement” (EDCA)](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2021-09-23/us-philippines-mutual-defense-treaty-duterte-2989695.html) which would improve facilities for US troops at agreed locations, enabling them to increase their rotational presence in the Philippines.

These improved ties during the later years of the Duterte administration and under Marcos occur in the light of increasing greater Chinese FDI in the Philippines economy.

The author includes

&gt;Winger and Amador point out that recent instances where the United States omitted or overlooked the Philippines have rankled. The reverse is also true: high-level engagement over the past year has been essential in rebooting the alliance. Whether these efforts can be sustained and deliver real gains in terms of US presence in the Philippines will be an essential litmus test of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy.

# CORRECTIONS

The author makes an error about Chinese FDI in the Philippines, saying its the largest foreign investor in the Philippines in the last five years.  According to the Central Bank of the Philippines, Chinese investment is small, with a total net investment of about US$600 Million since 2017. Japanese FDI in 2020 exceeds Chinese investment for the five-year time period.

The reason many believe this is skewed data presentation with titles like “Oilsands production emits twice as much carbon”.  That statement may be true…but it doesn’t take into the account that 80-85% of a barrel of oil’s carbon is done when it’s burned, no matter where it came from.

So a Canadian barrel may emit 5-7% more emissions on the whole, yet is labeled “dirty”.  And this is why we have such an energy problem, because we are sacrificing energy security for marginal emission gains.

See the table on the second page, and this is older data too that doesn’t show the improvements in emission reductions.

So just asking 3 questions to further my understanding.

My first question is what is Putin’s rationale for the invasion?

I understand Putin has twisted history to suggest that Ukraine is an artificial country created by Russia. My understanding is there is a grain of truth in every lie and that it is true that historically both Ukrainians and Russians descend from the Kievan-Rus, but that they over time become distinct ethnic groups. My understanding is also that Russia has for the past few centuries been the imperial overlord over Ukraine, and so whilst Russians have at times considered Ukrainians as a subset of Russians, the Ukrainians have always held onto their national identity even when they haven’t had a state (a la the English and say the Welsh or Irish).

I find it really hard to believe that Putin really thought that Ukraine was run by “Western controlled, Russophobic neo-nazis”. Surely that was just his excuse towards the Russian people who I am sure are not naturally inclined to wage war against a nation they consider similar to themselves. Or maybe he did believe it. 

Currently I feel that he does indeed believe they are “western controlled” even if not russophobic or neo nazi and that is his real reason for invading. My personal view is not that Ukraine is Western controlled but western leaning.

My second question is what are the wider factors that led to Russia’s invasion?

I used to think this war was all about NATO expansion, black and white, pure and simple. I found (and still find) Mearsheimer’s analysis compelling to a degree. Having said that I have listened to the analysis of those who think he’s completely wrong and have often found them compelling that this is more a war of re-establishing a Russian Empire and could be the start of further Russian expansion.

I now think that there are probably several factors of which NATO expansion is a significant factor, but just one of many. However I think Putin is a man with imperialistic ambitions for Russia and that even if he were not to invade other countries immediately after Ukraine, he/leaders after him may do so once Russia gains the capabilities.

It seems to me that Russia due to its history and size is a paranoid nation, one that sees domination of its neighbours as the only means to ensure security. This then results in its neighbours feeling paranoid and then fuels NATO expansion eastwards, further fuelling Russian paranoia. Ontop of that the USA isn’t exactly free from paranoia itself when it comes to Russia and has been hawkish at times when it needn’t have been post soviet collapse. 

This isn’t to suggest that Russia is not to blame for the invasion, I think they are 100% to blame. I am just seeking to understand to what extent all these factors (imperialistic ambition, security concerns due to NATO expansion, Putin’s personal vulnerability, perceived US weakness etc) have contributed to the current situation.

My last question is what is the likely end point?

I hear a lot of people say from a purely moralistic perspective that this ends once all Ukrainian territory is handed back, including Crimea.

I think this would be ideal but I don’t think it’s likely. I’m not even convinced that this is the USA’s primary geopolitical objective in arming Ukraine but a secondary objective. It seems to me their primary objective is to weaken Russia. As such I assume that once weakening Russia is expending too many US resources for their liking they will encourage the Ukrainians to sit and talk.

I suspect this will end with the eastern annexed regions being handed back with autonomy, a 50/50 possibility that Crimea is handed back with huge amounts of autonomy and a guarantee that Ukraine doesn’t join the EU/NATO. I don’t think that would be a definitive end to the conflict (which I see as taking decades to resolve) just the short term war. I just don’t see how the conflict ends without Ukraine being able to maintain territorial integrity or without Russia being able to say “at least they aren’t Western” (although on this last point I think a “neutral” Ukraine wouldn’t be very neutral at all).",True,False,,,,,0,1666532465,,True,0,{},itgf8rf,False,t3_t020va,False,False,,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/itgf8rf/,3,False,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1667902514,1670705510,5e0533598e449c3107508fe5a910a1f99f905d27,2022-10-23 13:41:05,,1.0,1666536031.0,

There are barely any pipelines that pass through the Appalachian mountain because of the U.S. and the Louisiana purchase and setting up great economic opportunities that started with farming. While we can now bore and blast through rock, it’s still cheaper to find flat land and go through large population hubs where shipping routes are already located and distribution hubs are located.

Now a quick search has showed oil tankers are safer than pipeline or rail and with the arctic shelf melting, we shouldn’t be worried about pipelines but creating efficient transportation networks through the Hudson Bay and Arctic, potentially through Churchill. The pipelines would follow be far cheaper and barges could be made that are far larger than those that would need to pass through the Panama Canal. Furthermore with better infrastructure this wouldn’t only impact shipping oils and natural gas but other products as well and it wouldn’t require one company to invest in a large pipeline but include multiple shipping companies to produce ships in different labour markets simultaneously.

The distance for a pipeline to Churchill, Manitoba would be 1,300 km to Edmonton compared to 4,800 km going for Edmonton to Halifax, Nova Scotia. This isn’t considering current pipeline infrastructure.

Anyway, appreciate the discussion.

The second best option would be for the bitumen to be shipped across the country and refined on the east coast, then the refined products exported abroad.

A less appealing scenario (and probably not one that makes a lot of economic sense) would be to ship bitumen overseas.

There was a pipeline project proposed that would take product from the heavy-oil producing regions in northern Alberta (near Canada's west coast) and pipe it to the east (Atlantic) coast, where it would then be refined in New Brunswick and shipped abroad.  That project was cancelled by the lead proponent, TransCanada, in 2017.

A lot of people seem to think that Justin Trudeau cancelled that project.  He did not, and the federal government (liberals) did not.  It was TransCanada that cancelled it, based upon opposition from Ontario and especially from Quebec.

Everybody wants cheap energy, but nobody wants pipelines.

But the good thing (for Canadians and especially for Albertans) is that any fossil fuel products that don't get extracted and used now will only become more valuable over time.
