Anyways, I hardly think accusing me of Putin apologism is called for. The polls I linked point out, among other things, how 20% of Americans believe Ukraine is getting too much support from the US, up from 7% at the beginning of the war in March. More and more Americans believe we are spending too much on Ukraine. Why? I dont know, but it likely for many reasons, among them economic issues at home. Ukraine kicking Russia's behind is also certainly a reason. 

My only point here is that if the economy gets worse, the trend of decreasing public support might go with it. NATO governments will then likely face pressure to reduce their spending on military support for Ukraine, and that will inturn increase the likelyhood of a diplomatic solution, as Ukraine's combat effectivness would deteriorate with a decrease in NATO support.

The defeat of the USSR was in a way just as disheartening and economically damaging to Russia as Germany’s 1918 defeat. In both cases it has caused questions to a national psyche that has caused violent out lash. 

The early German Empire was seem by many as destined to surpass Britain as the world’s leading power. They had at last decisively defeated France, and France could not hope to defeat Germany alone with its demographic and economic struggles. Britain too was seemingly slowing down while Germany’s industrial growth was red-hot. Germany needed to take its “place in the sun,” which many felt would be accomplished through war at some point. 

Germany of course lost the war. The monarchy fell, their overseas possessions were stripped, and Danzig was taken from them. Germany had failed to measure up to the other European powers, and especially newcomer America. Germany wasn’t the world’s leading power, it maybe wasn’t even #2. As a people though, Germans refused to accept that their national myth of greatness had been wrong. The Nazis promised to set things right: punishing the “traitors” who had caused their defeat (Jews), end the interference of others in their affairs (France and Britain), and ensure that the German people would have the land they needed to expand and grow (lebensraum). Germany committed to one of the bloodiest and most despicable courses of all time to achieve these goals, only to fail again to the very same circumstances that had cost them in 1918. Only then did Germany accept that it was not and didn’t need to be the acknowledged leader of the world. 

Russians are in similar circumstances these days. Their victory in WWII made the USSR one of two superpowers, and many believed themselves to be stronger and better than the US. The collapse of the USSR was shocking to people who had largely believed such a thing to be impossible, and the subsequent hardships and loss of empire has made Russia just as vulnerable to nationalistic dreams of “restoration.”

Likewise, Russia now finds itself lashing out with violence towards its neighbors as it tries to recapture former power and glory. Fortunately, Russia does not have an equivalent to the Prussian military tradition to fall back on, and it has largely been in industrial decline. Also NATO has been far less passive as a whole (exceptions are notable) with adequately preparing to fight Russia if needed. I suppose it’s as though France and Britain were actually able to provide Czechoslovakia with adequate support to oppose Germany while not going to war themselves. 

Anyways, the question for the West remains how to get Russia to abandon its goal without unleashing its nukes. Maybe presenting a non-imperialist vision of Russia as part of Europe would help, but I think Russia needs deep structural changes to its state if it is going to do something like that.

Chinese in general love to boast and make a lot of noise, but when you look at the number, it is still not as big as the Japanese.

Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv in September underscored the magnitude of Putin’s error. As Russian forces grew exhausted, losing momentum on the battlefield, Ukraine seized the initiative, dealing the Russian military a decisive blow. Ukraine’s battlefield successes revealed the extent of the rot in Putin’s army—the sagging morale, the declining manpower, the deteriorating quality of the troops. Instead of giving up, however, Putin responded to these problems by ordering a partial military mobilization, introducing tougher punishments for soldiers who desert or surrender, and moving forward with the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Putin reacted to Russia’s falling fortunes in Ukraine just as he did to its shrinking role on the world stage: dealt a losing hand, he doubled down on his risky bet. To Putin’s evident surprise, the war in Ukraine has accelerated long-standing trends pushing his country toward decline. Europe is moving to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, diminishing both the country’s leverage over the continent and the government revenues that depend heavily on energy exports. Unprecedented international sanctions and export controls are limiting Russia’s access to capital and technology, which will cause Moscow to fall even further behind in innovation. A year ago, we argued in these pages that reports of Russia’s decline were overstated and that Russia was poised to remain a persistent power—a country facing structural challenges but maintaining the intent and capabilities to threaten the United States and its allies. Putin’s disastrous invasion underscored the dangers of dismissing the threat from Russia, but it has also hastened the country’s decline. Today, Russia’s long-term outlook is decidedly dimmer.  
Given these factors, there will be a strong temptation to downgrade Russia as a threat. That would be a mistake, and not just because the war has yet to be won. In Ukraine and elsewhere, the more vulnerable Moscow perceives itself to be, the more it will try to offset those vulnerabilities by relying on unconventional tools—including nuclear weapons. In other words, Russian power and influence may be diminished, but that does not mean Russia will become dramatically less threatening. Instead, some aspects of the threat are likely to worsen. For the West, recognizing that reality means abandoning any near-term hopes of a chastened Russia and maintaining support for Russia’s targets. That effort should begin in Ukraine: the United States and its allies must provide sustained support to Kyiv to ensure that Russia suffers a defeat. But even if Putin loses, the problem that Russia poses will not be solved. In many ways, it will grow in intensity.

If Russia manages to force it's will and reach their objectives or more, their struggles to do so will be a paranthesis in the larger story of an otherwise successful invasion.

This report examines how worldwide attitudes towards the major international powers – China, Russia, and the United States – are shifting in the wake of the Ukraine war, China’s rising assertiveness, and recent challenges to American democracy.

They do so by harmonising and merging data from 30 global survey projects that collectively span 137 countries which represent 97% of world population. This includes 75 countries surveyed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, giving us updated insights into the current views of 83% of all people across the globe.

As a result, Their analysis covers not only high-income democracies but also a comprehensive coverage of emerging economies and the Global South – revealing a marked divergence between the two.

On the one hand, western democracies stand more firmly than ever behind the United States. Not only that, but the war in Ukraine has galvanised democratic societies worldwide – as the peoples of upper-income democracies in South America, the Asia-Pacific, and Eastern Europe have also moved to a more pro-American stance.

However, across a vast span of countries stretching from continental Eurasia to the north and west of Africa, they find the opposite – societies that have moved closer to China and Russia over the course of the last decade. As a result, China and Russia are now narrowly ahead of the United States in their popularity among developing countries.

While the war in Ukraine has accentuated this divide, it has been a decade in the making. As a result, the world is torn between two opposing clusters: a maritime alliance of democracies, led by the United States; and a Eurasian bloc of illiberal or autocratic states, centred upon Russia and China.

They suggest that this new cleavage cannot be reduced to simple economic interests or geopolitical convenience. Rather, it follows a clear political and ideological divide. Across the world, the strongest predictors of how societies align respective to China or the United States are their fundamental values and institutions – including beliefs in freedom of expression, personal choice, and the extent to which democratic institutions are practised and perceived to be legitimate.",True,False,,,,,0,1667239981,,False,0,{},iuizvmw,False,t3_yiju0i,False,True,,/r/geopolitics/comments/yiju0i/a_world_divided_russia_china_and_the_west/iuizvmw/,1667846717,1,False,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,public,,0,[],,1670708078,dffe08f6eba14b9e5d19e577d88abb29ecd61bc1,2022-10-31 18:13:01,1.0,,,r/geopolitics

In many of these nations, Japanese FDI and in other cases US, World Bank, Asian Development Bank etc. investment far exceeds Chinese.

Something else about Chinese investment into the Philippines. While few major overseas development assistance (ODA) projects by the Chinese have been undertaken in the Philippines under Duterte, a lot of other Chinese money going there [has been put into small and medium businesses in the wholesale and retail sector, construction, transportation and services](https://thediplomat.com/2022/04/beyond-infrastructure-chinese-capital-in-the-philippines-under-duterte/), represented as Filipino businesses to the Philippine government to avoid regulations, while crowding out and putting actual Filipino companies out of business.

And then there is ""flexible capital"", where Chinese billionaires are pulling their money out of China and placing it into sectors of the economies of Southeast Asian countries that have little regulatory control, such as slave and child labor exploiting resource extraction and in the Philippines, illegal gambling:

&gt;Approximately 129 online gambling firms began their operations by legally or illegally importing hundreds of thousands of Chinese-speaking workers. Online gambling firms have purchased a huge stock of condominium units in Metro Manila, leading to the increase in real estate prices beyond the range that most Filipinos can afford. Manila’s land prices rose an average of 6 percent in 2017, with the Manila Bay Area seeing the biggest increase at 27 percent. Alongside online gambling, on-site casinos with escort services have expanded in Metro Manila, booked through WeChat, the Chinese chat client, to cater to Chinese, East Asian, Filipino, and Western customers. Unregistered online gambling firms, which frequently conduct internet fraud, have also proliferated across the capital. Despite online gambling’s divestment due to COVID-19 in 2020, online gambling has become a mainstay economic sector in the Philippines.

Yes, Duterte presided over a large influx in Chinese investment over his tenure, but rather than into large-scale projects that benefit Filipinos, it has been into taking over retail and service sectors and put into illicit activities. Filipinos understand this and it is reflected in their growing distrust of the Chinese and their influence over their politicians.

This is true for many Southeast Asian countries, and people who want to play up and parade China's successes there will point to the corrupt officials that bought in with them while ignoring and minimizing what the people who actually live in these places say and think.

It took French, British and Ottoman forces a year to capture the city...

&gt;the city endured its toughest ordeal during World War II. In 1941-42, Red Army soldiers and Black Sea Fleet sailors defended it from Nazi troops for 250 days and nights.

* End of the Cold War resulted in large reductions in defense, known as the Peace Dividend. Size of militaries shrunk, conscription became less common, and NATO expanded into Eastern Europe.
* European responses to the war have been generally aligned but there are still issues. War confirmed that Russia is still the primary threat to Europe and has led to some countries initiating rapid rearmament programs.
* In 2021, Europe spent $347 billion on defense. The US spent $793 billion. UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Poland are the biggest spenders. Eastern Europe has a higher PPP (more bang for the buck). Europe also has large amounts of reserve manpower, especially Turkey, Finland, and Greece. This reserve is hundreds of thousands of people.
* 6,600 active MBTs and 6,600 artillery systems. US has about 2,500 and 3,800 respectively. Those European numbers represent a wide range of systems from brand new equipment to stuff that would’ve looked common in 1960s Germany.
* Navy: European collectively has many vessels designed for coastal work. About 573 patrol and coastal combatants, 59 SSKs, 108 frigates, 28 DDGs. Again, these vessels range greatly in capabilities.
* Air: 2k frontline aircraft, quality spectrum is large with a growing focus on high end platforms. 4-4.5 gen aircraft are common and generally modern &amp; capable.

Problems Europe faces:

* There is no single European military. Each country has its own foreign policy, perspectives, etc. Harder to operate in unison. Collective defense is one thing, using power abroad is another thing and is much more complicated.
* Europe CAN, on paper, defend itself and conduct offensive operations if needed. However, whether they WOULD is much more complicated due to the politics of the continent.
* Standardization is an issue, with it being inconsistent across Europe. Many countries still using vey old equipment.
* European stockpiles not sufficient for large scale conflict. They also rely heavily on US logistical muscle (see: Libya intervention).",True,False,,,,,0,1667162301,,False,0,{},iuez6n6,True,t3_yhp7j9,False,True,,/r/geopolitics/comments/yhp7j9/european_defence_the_russian_challenge_third/iuez6n6/,1667853297,2,False,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,public,,0,[],,1670707881,a720b73dde5033b5aab9f6135ae93072ccd7e981,2022-10-30 20:38:21,1.0,,,r/geopolitics

[],False,,Luc3121,1455961650.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_vb792,,False,False,"I think a federal EU has become less likely actually! With the war in Ukraine, the EU is being seen more and more as a political project to protect and strengthen sovereignty defined in nation-state terms, at least for former communist countries and a possible future accession of Ukraine. These countries won't accept a EU defined in other terms than it is now, especially when it comes to giving up national symbols or perhaps even the nation state. It will take multiple generations for a country like Ukraine to have its public ready for a federal EU like most of us on Reddit would imagine it to be like (as an ideological, anti-nationalist project to finish what was started after the second world war by the Inner Six).

Next to that, the war has made it clearer that European security depends on the US. Even with many countries amping up investment to meet the NATO's suggestion to spend at least 2.0% of GDP on defence, Ukraine and Eastern Europe in general sees that it cannot rely on the EU's 'Inner Six' for their security. This has probably made a EU defence union less likely. On the other hand, Orban's behaviour, I don't know whether it's bluff or not, could cause a rupture in the sort of pact Poland and Hungary have in the EU Council and eventually lead to less national veto powers over foreign policy, perhaps even paving the way for a common foreign policy.

I think a lot will depend on the outcome and length of the war in Ukraine and the outcome of future US elections. If the US shows it can be a reliable partner to Eastern Europe for the long term, it will be preferable for Eastern European countries in the EU to focus on security through NATO rather than the EU. If Trump gets re-elected, then expect France and/or Germany to successfully take the initiative for a geopolitical union.

I think the increased support for the EU you mention will find its way to policy-making through:

- an increase in support (or decline in resistance) from skeptical countries like France and the Netherlands for eastward EU expansion

- an increase in support for further European integration on security and defence from Western European countries

- a decrease in seeing the EU as primarily being a trade union

though, because of the weak support of Western European countries for Ukraine (especially financially, compared to the US):

- an increase in the likelihood of a two-speed EU, as I see it as unlikely for Eastern Europe to want to rely on France, Italy and Germany over the US and the UK


and finally, due to the inflation hitting the EU to the detriment of the countries at full employment with low public debt, while it's not that bad for countries with high public debt and high unemployment:

- increase in likelihood of a more unified Eurozone fiscal policy, because trade imbalances caused by the way the Eurozone is designed (causing an overheated housing and job market), which benefited the Netherlands and Germany over Southern Europe so far, are becoming a drag on the Netherlands and Germany.

&gt;Why would a sovereign nation want to subject itself to diktats made in Brussels?



They aren't ""diktats"", they're simply the decisions of a supranational federal government. And you could ask the same question for the current EU: why would a sovereign nation give up the power to make its own economic or monetary choices? United we can achieve more and it makes sense from a pragmatic point of view. Estonia, Malta, Slovakia or Ireland alone would be nothing, but together they can have a voice on the international stage.




&gt;The moment things go south, which at some point is inevitable, everyone will jump ship.



That's an assumption, which isn't really likely given the recent events. You work on the assumption that there is no cooperation, and because of that countries should not cooperate. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that is being proven wrong by the current situation in Ukraine



&gt;The EU is a trade union and should remain so, you start forcing sovereign nation into enacting laws they might not like and you will find yourself in a shitstorm.



The EU has never quite been a trade union. Adenauer, Schuman and De Gasperi were pretty clear about a federal Europe, and many governments since then have re-affirmed their vision of a federal union (the most recent being the current German government). It's clear to anyone that actually looks at the EU: there's a European parliament. It is political. 


But even working on the assumption that it is an economic and monetary union, getting rid of the veto while strengthening the qualified majority would help in economic and monetary matters as well, take eurobonds as an example



&gt;the EU is not as effective at managing many policy areas

I agree. That's why the EU should focus on certain key areas such as foreign policy, trade and economic growth while leaving most social and ethical issues to member states. But it's not really what we're talking about, it's a flaw of the EU that can be removed by just giving the policy areas back to member states



&gt;it is foolish to think that it can please 27 member states all at once. The EU often ends up reaching a compromise that no-one finds satisfactory because it always has to try to please all of its members. This will become even worst has the current policy in Brussels is one of expansionism and trying to acquire as many member states as they possibly can.


Exactly, you outlined the major reasons why there should not be a veto!

This isn't *only* because of political bias, to be fair.

France wants some kind of european united states, a major player in the world stage as a multiplyer of France strategic culture. It less a french control than a french vision of a wide European political space independant from the USA and able to have better relations with its neighbours (Russia, UK, Turkey). It is a long term and rather utopic vision.

  
Germany wants to be the economic and political core of the Union, the rest being peripherical. Meanwhile the USA being the strategic patron of the EU. The EU and the Euro have already been led in this direction for the last 20 years, by a German insincer and egoist policy, and it is already half done. So the German control is coupled with an american one, we can see it everyday.

  
For my part, this German-US Europe is an historical mistake and a cultural nonsense, that will lead to disintegration and nationalism. The very disasters EU was build to avoid. Look how Poland and Hungary are showing the way (""I take the money, \*\*\*\* you"").

Why would Ukraine a sovereign country want to join NATO? Its not like they have to fear Russia invading, right? 

In any case support for joining NATO shot up in Ukraine after Russia invaded in 2014 and increased even more after the larger invasion this year

&gt;by meddling with disinformation campaigns in Ukraine and Russia, by providing support to certain political groups in Russia and Ukraine that are anti-Russia thus interfering with the politics of other countries.

[],False,,ekw88,1360814256.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_aldhe,,False,False,"Diplomacy and thus appeasement is the only off ramp we have to stabilize the conflict.

From Russia’s perspective, they’ve been appeasing NATO for 30 years as it pulled more former USSR states into its orbit and toppled Russia’s efforts to recoup the heights of its former self. 

In the mainstream US perspective, history started when Russia invaded in 2014 then 2022, so appeasement would be perceived as up Ukraine for free to a &lt;insert trigger words&gt; Russia. US politics may dissuade its statesmen to diverge from the mainstream.

They’re still at a deadlock to start diplomacy. As many deduced - the only path forward is escalation, prolonged conflict, and the chances to use more destructive weaponry continues to rise.

So I would predict these are the conditions we can look for where diplomacy would be more likely:

On the US side, recession is in its prime, NATO states continue to pressure US to alleviate the economic pain and start to question/mitigate its security/economic relationship with the US. US enters the negotiating table with Russia; Note here Ukraine has no agency in this regard and will be forced to accept the outcome.

On the Russia side, China and US starts to relax tensions and align towards global growth - weakening Russia’s position in Ukraine as its major trading partner prioritizes its US relationship; it needs to put diplomacy on the table and cash out below their bottom line.

On the Ukraine side, war continues to escalate where significant destruction outweighs its will to continue fighting.

Or both. Both is good. And of course why does the US want to weaken Russia? The invasion of Ukraine especially this current larger invasion is the top reason to not want Russia to have power 

&gt;  and the larger mission to divide the Eurasian continent.

Europe at least seems pretty united to me, more then it has been for a long time.

There was peace with Ukraine before 2014. 

In 2012 Zelenskyy not yet a politician but a comedian staring in a romantic comedy called Eight First Dates a collaboration between his Ukranian studio and Russian studio/actors. One of Russias film awards named it the Best Russian Comedy of the Year.

Despite a lot of nasty history there were many Ukranians who thought positively of Russia at the time. Lots of cultural influence, trade, etc. Russia could have used that to nurture a positive relationship (or maybe it wasn't capable of doing so under Putin?) Instead it sought to control and dominate and perhaps reconquer Ukraine.

Right now the EU is in one of its strongest moments so far: it managed to pass a set of very sensible &amp; necessary policies with the COVID response, and has been able to capitalize on a number of matters since then, with especially the European Parliament consistently passing popular policies and becoming one of the most popular institutions of the continent. In particular: coordinating border closures and vaccine distribution between countries avoided a lot of chaos, and the recovery fund seems to have been a success for the most part. And beating the expectations from her less-than-stellar career in German politics, von der Leyen has been a surprisingly effective/competent looking leader in this time, at least in figurehead capacity (she seems to be a decent speaker in multiple languages).

But as to significant short term federalization on top of what was passed during COVID --- I'm still leaning no.

On organizational, human rights, and economic policies, there are a few holdouts for each category that would likely veto the most important reforms.

On defense, currently the solution seems to be NATO, which has been massively reinvigorated this year, and will very soon include every single border state of the EU. And the key Poland &amp; Baltic states aren't willing to trust their defense in the hands of the French initiatives at a strategically self-sufficient EU (as opposed to EU &amp; USA partnership, which is more or less synonymous to NATO). There are two reasons. First, the French political environment is fickle, so the EU's only nuclear guarantee could disappear after a big political change. And second, in certain categories, America just sells better military equipment than any other vendor. There are good fighter jets produced in the EU (Rafale, Typhoon, Gripen) but to the frustration of the French government, *nothing* matches the F-35. (In fact the EU aviation industry is just sitting out the entire 5th gen, and is instead investing in the 6th gen drone-complemented fighter with the FCAS program)
