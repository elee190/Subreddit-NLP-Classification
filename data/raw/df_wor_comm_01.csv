Over the next three days, he invited friends and family to view the strange glowing substance.

On September 21, at the scrapyard, one of Ferreira's friends (identified as ""EF1"" in the IAEA report) succeeded in freeing several rice-sized grains of the glowing material from the capsule using a screwdriver. Ferreira began to share some of them with various friends and family members. That same day, his wife, 37-year-old Maria Gabriela Ferreira, began to fall ill. On September 25, 1987, Devair Ferreira sold the scrap metal to a third scrapyard.

&gt; Iran expects to take delivery of a number of Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets from Russia early next Iranian year, which starts in March, a lawmaker said.

&gt; Speaking to Tasnim, member of the Iranian Parliament&amp;#039;s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Shahriar Heidari said the Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets that Iran has ordered from Russia are going to arrive in early 1402.

&gt; Media reports suggested earlier that Iran will receive 24 of the fourth-generation twin-engine, super-maneuverable fighter jets that are primarily used for air superiority missions.

&gt; The head of the European Parliament Press Service Neil Corlett said on Friday that the legislative body will convene next week to discuss sanctions against Iran, as more than 100 members push to designate Iran&amp;#039;s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.

&gt; European legislators called this week to designate Iran&amp;#039;s powerful the IRGC as a terrorist organization and to impose other sanctions, following Iranian crackdown on nationwide protests that started in September.

&gt; Among the measures proposed in the letter are the designation of the IRGC as terror group, expanding the EU sanctions list to include Iranian leaders and tightening EU sanctions on dual-use materials and equipment.

&gt; Ukraine officials on Sunday stated which Russian military outfit they believe was responsible for the bombing of a high-rise apartment building in Dnipro that has led to more than two dozen deaths.

&gt; &amp;quot;According to preliminary information, the Kh-22 missile was used. This type of missile leads to the greatest human casualties, because the missile is extremely inaccurate, has a huge deviation. Therefore, the use of such weapons for targets in densely populated areas is clearly a war crime,&amp;quot; the Ukraine office said in a Telegram post.

&gt; &amp;quot;In the Armed Forces of Ukraine there are no fire devices capable of shooting down this type of missile. Since the beginning of Russian military aggression on Ukraine, more than 210 missiles of this type have been launched. None of them are knocked down by air defense equipment,&amp;quot; said Lieutenant General Nikolai Oleshuk, Commander of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

What do you mean by evidence? Because in my profession evidence means contemporary primary evidence (phsyical), followed by secondary sources followed by comparative sources. 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3. The problem is primary evidence rarely tells you about religion (a stone temple foundation does not tell you the prayers that were said). The secondary sources are always unreliable and later or simply do not exist (if you write down a story tomorrow about today, it is secondary - every piece of written evidence is a secondary source). Finally, and least important, is comparative - later stuff that looks like it fits. 

Most religious arguments I have, people flip the importance so comparative &gt; secondary &gt; primary. 

This is the real picture: primary is the only one that counts. Secondary is what we use to try and make it make sense, but it is unreliable. Comparative is least important, by a long mile. 

Knowing that someone use a cup to drink, does not tell you what they thought. We have 1000s of ancient cups. 10000s of them. Not one helps us.

If Canada was a member of AUKUS, they'd effectively offer nothing to the group. Canadian and Australian militaries are roughly the same size; 68K vs 60K. Yet, Australia's military budget is almost 50% greater, with much of that going into R&amp;D.

* Australia is a world leader in loyal wingman UAVs. MQ-28 is probably the single most advanced loyal wingman UAV in the world that we know of, and it's entirely Australian.
* Australia is pumping billions into hypersonic weapons research, and is combining efforts with the US' programs. 

Canada brings nothing to that hyper advanced R&amp;D table, and doesn't even have money to simply sit on the sidelines and fund projects. Inviting them does nothing to really assist in any of the projects that fall under it unfortunately, which is why no one talks about inviting Canada, but Australia and the US have both discussed inviting Japan to join. That's because Japan will fund projects, and Japan will bring engineers. 

That, and Canada's refusal to accept the rest of the world's consensus that the NW Passage is in fact, an international strait (still Canadian territorial waters where all resources within it are the rights of Canada, but it means it's a body of water that links to bodies of international water together, and that would allow ships of any nation to be able to sail through it under the right of transit passage).

There are other metals with similar or greater weights, but all of them are either too expensive or too radioactive (and probably also too expensive). Gold and platinum group metals would work, but they cost hundreds to thousands per ounce, while uranium is only $30-50 per pound. The only other metal with a similar price at that density is tungsten, with a density of 19.3 g/cm^3 although It’s very hard to work with, as it has such a high melting point. It’s commodity price is about $30/kg but from what I can tell that’s either in a partially processed state or in a powder. The cost goes up a lot to make it into a solid metal bar. So my guess is it would be around twice as expensive as depleted uranium. That makes it a practical alternative but only if airplane manufacturers are required by law since they otherwise would want to save costs where possible.

Day 325-326 of my updates from Kharkiv.

These past 2 days were just horrible, as they usually are after a new missile strike happens. Here in Kharkiv the situation is stable right now. Yesterday we lost electricity around 3:40pm, but it was restored pretty fast, some places already had it back up after a couple of hours, for us specifically it took until 11pm, which is still very fast. By this morning the electricity was already restored everywhere in Kharkiv oblast, but there is still a big energy generation deficit in the system because Russians managed to hit 2 of our thermal power plants, so some cities will have longer blackouts for some time until those are fixed/rerouted.

While the electricity problems do suck, the missile strikes on civilians yesterday are much worse, and they hurt much more than sitting without electricity for a couple of hours. It’s not something that would ever break our spirit or make us surrender, but seeing innocent civilians killed by the fucking Russian terrorists is just enraging. 

And Russians were extremely happy when the news about apartment block in Dnipro being hit were released, they want more of it. It disgusts me that so many people defend Russians, saying they are “innocent”, while those “innocent Russians” gloat about our civilians being killed by missiles every single time it happens. How the fuck can you be happy about our civilians being killed and innocent at the same time?

So they spend however they want, beyond a certain wealth level that's just a given and it doesn't change for even someone like Elon Musk after losing a ton of dough. Why would you think having more or less makes a difference when you don't see it? Someone needs to tell them and ELI5.

That wealth is going into something. It doesn't just sit in a bank vault like Midas' pile of gold. It's involved in the economy. It touches things. It's especially true when things go sideways like the 2007/08 mortgage crisis caused by bad loans to home buyers or with the recent crypto market collapse. Why did that one happen? It was probably simple fraud, but it happened. The money lost went somewhere and that shift of wealth affects things.

I often complain about Reaganomics and how it said that Labor didn't ever deserve more of the nation's GDP because it was stagnant and only Capital could positively change the economy for the better, thus meaning only the super-rich with lots of Capital to invest deserve the new gains. That shift of wealth has led, at least in part, to this new situation. But, going forward the situation is not good.

Why did the rents go up suddenly? New money was pumped into properties and the greedy b****rds upped rents because they (thought) they could get away with it. Well, a housing price collapse is due and those who sold properties and got wads of cash are the winners. Buyers will bust and lose a bunch. Meanwhile, in the real world, renters will suffer from no bad behavior whatsoever. That's where this is a bad system.

Reaganomics needs to be rethought, though I like the markets being more open to people and lower tax rates (the WWII rates were no longer needed), and the way the Fed can handle interest rates and other things. Bernanke was a great US hero in the 2007/08 crisis.",,,False,False,[],False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_10czx4r,,,True,/r/worldnews/comments/10czx4r/call_for_new_taxes_on_superrich_after_1_pocket/j4iulrb/,public,False,,[],1673830326,r/worldnews,0,,,,1673830341,1673830342,bdaf4fd9fcc1a3d45441bcbda9bd896300c94496,2023-01-16 00:52:06,1.0,
