Even tungsten steel (10-20% tungsten) has this issue (that's why it's used for drill bits and other cutting tools).

Everything else with that kind of density is either expensive (gold, platinum, osmium, iridium, rhenium) or expensive and dangerous (non-depleted uranium, plutonium).

Israel integrated the Lehi terror group directly into the IDF and made on it's leaders prime minister and head of the Mossad.

This was decades before Ben-Gvir or Abbas were major players on either side of the green line.

&gt;  I don’t agree with your Nazi analogy using Ben gvir because it implies that Al aqsa is exclusively a Muslim site and should be.

I didn't say it was exclusive to anyone, I said it was a place of extreme religious and cultural significance to Arabs and Israel just sent it's most extreme anti Arab political figure to march around inside of it.

&gt; Its more similar to Nazism that the Jews are essentially banned by the Arabs

Al Aqsa, like all of Israel and Palestine, is under the de facto rule of Israel. The current arrangement exists because Israel's own elected representatives agreed to it.

he doesn't use such things now because he's bet hedging. they're catastrophic weapons that would put his future in real jeopardy. currently he imagines he can take Crimea and donbas and come out and be a normal world leader again a few years from now. he couldn't do that if he were forced to use those weapons. but guess what? if he starts to lose anyway, and if it becomes apparent to him that he will absolutely not go home with a consolation prize he will likely choose to escalate to those larger bombs. he will risk losing those planes, and risk everything because he'll know he can't survive as president of Russia after losing the war.
