NATO governments will then likely face pressure to reduce their spending on military support for Ukraine, and that will inturn increase the likelyhood of a diplomatic solution, as Ukraine's combat effectivness would deteriorate with a decrease in NATO support.

There were actual reasons to believe that (even after the Tiananmen massacre) the CCP would eventually find it itself in a situation where their best option would be democratising the country.

Maybe it was meant to play into domestic elite dynamics as well somehow, like undercutting more nationalist factions or something like that.   The idea that Putin or the Russian regime are trying to form more defensible frontiers on invasion routes is ridiculous though. For starters, just in a myopic military sense, terrain has become a less important factor over time, compared to things like infrastructure and institutional quality of the armed forces and tech (all of which we are seeing play out in Ukraine, e.g. railroads for Russian logistics, the corruption issues in the Russian armed forces, etc.).

"I wouldn't say it's literally impossible for Russia to win since technically there remains a possibility, but it's pretty close to impossible. They lost the fight when they were forced to retreat in Kyiv. Even if they had won a quick change in government they would probably have faced a long and violent occupation that would probably have eventually forced them to leave. Ukraine is united and determined. Ukraine has more troops in the area and the disadvantage will likely grow. Furthermore Ukranian troops are better trained and equipped and this this disadvantage will only grow as Russia tries to speed rush untrained troops to the front to stop the retreats/collapses. Russia can kill some amount of civilians but only enough to piss off Ukraine, not enough to force them to surrender. Also Russia can't keep this up for  @  years their economy is collapsing and they are losing troops at a rapid clip in a war where the people don't care about.

"Ive said several times that current Russia reminds me of  @  @  @  @ s Germany. The defeat of the USSR was in a way just as disheartening and economically damaging to Russia as Germanys  @  @  @  @  defeat. In both cases it has caused questions to a national psyche that has caused violent out lash.   The early German Empire was seem by many as destined to surpass Britain as the worlds leading power. They had at last decisively defeated France, and France could not hope to defeat Germany alone with its demographic and economic struggles. Britain too was seemingly slowing down while Germanys industrial growth was red-hot. Germany needed to take its place in the sun, which many felt would be accomplished through war at some point.   Germany of course lost the war. The monarchy fell, their overseas possessions were stripped, and Danzig was taken from them. Germany had failed to measure up to the other European powers, and especially newcomer America. Germany wasnt the worlds leading power, it maybe wasnt even # @ . As a people though, Germans refused to accept that their national myth of greatness had been wrong. The Nazis promised to set things right: punishing the traitors who had caused their defeat (Jews), end the interference of others in their affairs (France and Britain), and ensure that the German people would have the land they needed to expand and grow (lebensraum). Germany committed to one of the bloodiest and most despicable courses of all time to achieve these goals, only to fail again to the very same circumstances that had cost them in  @  @  @  @ . Only then did Germany accept that it was not and didnt need to be the acknowledged leader of the world.   Russians are in similar circumstances these days. Their victory in WWII made the USSR one of two superpowers, and many believed themselves to be stronger and better than the US. The collapse of the USSR was shocking to people who had largely believed such a thing to be impossible, and the subsequent hardships and loss of empire has made Russia just as vulnerable to nationalistic dreams of restoration.  Likewise, Russia now finds itself lashing out with violence towards its neighbors as it tries to recapture former power and glory. Fortunately, Russia does not have an equivalent to the Prussian military tradition to fall back on, and it has largely been in industrial decline. Also NATO has been far less passive as a whole (exceptions are notable) with adequately preparing to fight Russia if needed. I suppose its as though France and Britain were actually able to provide Czechoslovakia with adequate support to oppose Germany while not going to war themselves.   Anyways, the question for the West remains how to get Russia to abandon its goal without unleashing its nukes. Maybe presenting a non-imperialist vision of Russia as part of Europe would help, but I think Russia needs deep structural changes to its state if it is going to do something like that. Like Germany and Japan, and France and Britain to a lesser extent, the dream of empire must by put to rest.",0,-0.9072

"\[SS from the essay by Andrea Kendall-Taylor, Senior Fellow and Director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security; and Michael Kofman, Research Program Director of the Russia Studies Program at the Center for Naval Analyses.\]  Ukraines offensive in Kharkiv in September underscored the magnitude of Putins error. As Russian forces grew exhausted, losing momentum on the battlefield, Ukraine seized the initiative, dealing the Russian military a decisive blow. Ukraines battlefield successes revealed the extent of the rot in Putins armythe sagging morale, the declining manpower, the deteriorating quality of the troops. Instead of giving up, however, Putin responded to these problems by ordering a partial military mobilization, introducing tougher punishments for soldiers who desert or surrender, and moving forward with the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Putin reacted to Russias falling fortunes in Ukraine just as he did to its shrinking role on the world stage: dealt a losing hand, he doubled down on his risky bet. To Putins evident surprise, the war in Ukraine has accelerated long-standing trends pushing his country toward decline. Europe is moving to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, diminishing both the countrys leverage over the continent and the government revenues that depend heavily on energy exports. Unprecedented international sanctions and export controls are limiting Russias access to capital and technology, which will cause Moscow to fall even further behind in innovation. A year ago, we argued in these pages that reports of Russias decline were overstated and that Russia was poised to remain a persistent powera country facing structural challenges but maintaining the intent and capabilities to threaten the United States and its allies. Putins disastrous invasion underscored the dangers of dismissing the threat from Russia, but it has also hastened the countrys decline. Today, Russias long-term outlook is decidedly dimmer.   Given these factors, there will be a strong temptation to downgrade Russia as a threat. That would be a mistake, and not just because the war has yet to be won. In Ukraine and elsewhere, the more vulnerable Moscow perceives itself to be, the more it will try to offset those vulnerabilities by relying on unconventional toolsincluding nuclear weapons. In other words, Russian power and influence may be diminished, but that does not mean Russia will become dramatically less threatening. Instead, some aspects of the threat are likely to worsen. For the West, recognizing that reality means abandoning any near-term hopes of a chastened Russia and maintaining support for Russias targets. That effort should begin in Ukraine: the United States and its allies must provide sustained support to Kyiv to ensure that Russia suffers a defeat. But even if Putin loses, the problem that Russia poses will not be solved. In many ways, it will grow in intensity. So, too, should the response to it.",0,-0.9936

It is a common tactic for a military power to use their least effective/outdated military equipment in a border skirmish.  This can be the most effective way to gain back the resources spent on such equipment (especially if you win the confrontation) while making sure such equipment is simultaneously destroyed.    It can be better than salvaging it.   In this way you also gain experience and training and veterancy for your military.   Some things can only be tested in a real battlefield environment for empirical results.   If you have some skirmish or war you can go try things out on this can help keep your military more prepared and current and trained.   Not to say this is entirely the case here but it could be a factor.  Staying at war is usually beneficial in many ways to a nation.

"If this war ends in this sort of twisted diplomacy, I guarantee you this era will be a renewed era of bold faced imperialism at the worst, and an era of intense Cold War conflict at the very least, with the USA being given license to pursue even more direct measures to secure its interest.   Because those who have shamed the Hegemon have supported its enemies expanding their national borders through naked conquest and interventionism all the same, on an ideological basis.  However, because of the sheer brutality being shown on display and an increasing disgust by good people towards senseless brutality, the USA will begin to see the shame of their situation: pandering to authoritarians was always a losing gamble. Sure, it made us money, and we got nice things for a time, but this diplomacy only benefits the Hegemon as an excuse to be more ruthless which hurts literally everyone.  So if this diplomacy, is achieved, we enter a decidedly more violent timeline with increasing disdain for the overseas murmurings of the malcontents of the liberal world order and increasing pain for them all the same, simply because if Ukraine is allowed to be crucified in the town square solely out of naked contempt for the Hegemon, the Hegemon will act accordingly.   The Hegemon is a manifold entity consisting of not only the USA but NATO and non-NATO Allies of the USA, all of which are viewing this situation with their EYES WIDE OPEN.  This diplomacy will only secure in the long game with barely justifiable retaliatory violence due to the sheer injustice, a Ukrainian victory (without selling it under the Bus) will secure a status quo order with an even more mighty (but not jaded) Hegemon.

While the war in Ukraine has accentuated this divide, it has been a decade in the making. As a result, the world is torn between two opposing clusters: a maritime alliance of democracies, led by the United States; and a Eurasian bloc of illiberal or autocratic states, centred upon Russia and China.  They suggest that this new cleavage cannot be reduced to simple economic interests or geopolitical convenience. Rather, it follows a clear political and ideological divide.

War confirmed that Russia is still the primary threat to Europe and has led to some countries initiating rapid rearmament programs. * In  @  @  @  @ , Europe spent $ @  @  @  billion on defense.

"The far right and far left in Western Europe have never really had a substantial impact on European integration, because they never get power.

"I think a federal EU has become less likely actually! With the war in Ukraine, the EU is being seen more and more as a political project to protect and strengthen sovereignty defined in nation-state terms, at least for former communist countries and a possible future accession of Ukraine. These countries won't accept a EU defined in other terms than it is now, especially when it comes to giving up national symbols or perhaps even the nation state. It will take multiple generations for a country like Ukraine to have its public ready for a federal EU like most of us on Reddit would imagine it to be like (as an ideological, anti-nationalist project to finish what was started after the second world war by the Inner Six).  Next to that, the war has made it clearer that European security depends on the US. Even with many countries amping up investment to meet the NATO's suggestion to spend at least  @ . @ % of GDP on defence, Ukraine and Eastern Europe in general sees that it cannot rely on the EU's 'Inner Six' for their security. This has probably made a EU defence union less likely. On the other hand, Orban's behaviour, I don't know whether it's bluff or not, could cause a rupture in the sort of pact Poland and Hungary have in the EU Council and eventually lead to less national veto powers over foreign policy, perhaps even paving the way for a common foreign policy.  I think a lot will depend on the outcome and length of the war in Ukraine and the outcome of future US elections. If the US shows it can be a reliable partner to Eastern Europe for the long term, it will be preferable for Eastern European countries in the EU to focus on security through NATO rather than the EU. If Trump gets re-elected, then expect France and/or Germany to successfully take the initiative for a geopolitical union.  I think the increased support for the EU you mention will find its way to policy-making through:  - an increase in support (or decline in resistance) from skeptical countries like France and the Netherlands for eastward EU expansion  - an increase in support for further European integration on security and defence from Western European countries  - a decrease in seeing the EU as primarily being a trade union  though, because of the weak support of Western European countries for Ukraine (especially financially, compared to the US):  - an increase in the likelihood of a two-speed EU, as I see it as unlikely for Eastern Europe to want to rely on France, Italy and Germany over the US and the UK   and finally, due to the inflation hitting the EU to the detriment of the countries at full employment with low public debt, while it's not that bad for countries with high public debt and high unemployment:  - increase in likelihood of a more unified Eurozone fiscal policy, because trade imbalances caused by the way the Eurozone is designed (causing an overheated housing and job market), which benefited the Netherlands and Germany over Southern Europe so far, are becoming a drag on the Netherlands and Germany.

"I'm not sure what you're arguing for - you started your comment by saying that the member states won't be in favour of the removal of the veto, but your reasoning is that the current EU has a veto.

They aren't ""diktats"", they're simply the decisions of a supranational federal government. And you could ask the same question for the current EU: why would a sovereign nation give up the power to make its own economic or monetary choices? United we can achieve more and it makes sense from a pragmatic point of view. Estonia, Malta, Slovakia or Ireland alone would be nothing, but together they can have a voice on the international stage.     &gt;The moment things go south, which at some point is inevitable, everyone will jump ship.

So I would predict these are the conditions we can look for where diplomacy would be more likely:  On the US side, recession is in its prime, NATO states continue to pressure US to alleviate the economic pain and start to question/mitigate its security/economic relationship with the US. US enters the negotiating table with Russia; Note here Ukraine has no agency in this regard and will be forced to accept the outcome.  On the Russia side, China and US starts to relax tensions and align towards global growth - weakening Russias position in Ukraine as its major trading partner prioritizes its US relationship; it needs to put diplomacy on the table and cash out below their bottom line.  On the Ukraine side, war continues to escalate where significant destruction outweighs its will to continue fighting.

"In the long term, everything is possible.  Right now the EU is in one of its strongest moments so far: it managed to pass a set of very sensible &amp; necessary policies with the COVID response, and has been able to capitalize on a number of matters since then, with especially the European Parliament consistently passing popular policies and becoming one of the most popular institutions of the continent. In particular: coordinating border closures and vaccine distribution between countries avoided a lot of chaos, and the recovery fund seems to have been a success for the most part. And beating the expectations from her less-than-stellar career in German politics, von der Leyen has been a surprisingly effective/competent looking leader in this time, at least in figurehead capacity (she seems to be a decent speaker in multiple languages).  But as to significant short term federalization on top of what was passed during COVID --- I'm still leaning no.  On organizational, human rights, and economic policies, there are a few holdouts for each category that would likely veto the most important reforms.  On defense, currently the solution seems to be NATO, which has been massively reinvigorated this year, and will very soon include every single border state of the EU. And the key Poland &amp; Baltic states aren't willing to trust their defense in the hands of the French initiatives at a strategically self-sufficient EU (as opposed to EU &amp; USA partnership, which is more or less synonymous to NATO). There are two reasons. First, the French political environment is fickle, so the EU's only nuclear guarantee could disappear after a big political change. And second, in certain categories, America just sells better military equipment than any other vendor. There are good fighter jets produced in the EU (Rafale, Typhoon, Gripen) but to the frustration of the French government, *nothing* matches the F- @  @ . (In fact the EU aviation industry is just sitting out the entire  @ th gen, and is instead investing in the  @ th gen drone-complemented fighter with the FCAS program)  I still think there's plenty of potential for a  @ -speed Europe style integration, however; at the moment there are some modestly euroskeptic governments like Italy, which are willing to collaborate on the rest of EU's mandate but might prefer to sit out some of the steps towards federalization.",0,0.9723

"Everything has a price; when it gets to the point where Ukraine or Russia is no longer willing to pay that price is when the war will end. Wars and armed conflicts though are not like business dealings - death and suffering begets grief and ultimately feelings of resentment and vengeance. In an ideal world, war would never be used. It's a net loss for everyone involved, but it is humanity's favorite past-time whenever our words fail us.   It is why words are so important now. Ukraine will never be able to out-right defeat Russia and it increasingly seems likewise for Russia with Ukraine. It risks becoming a stalemate like the war between Iraq and Iran where neither belligerent is able to gain the upper hand over the other.

A protracted war could benefit Washington to the extent that it weakens Moscow and forces it to pare back its ambitions elsewhere. But a war that drags on would also have significant downsides for the United States. It would continue to eat up military and financial resources as well as the time and energy of U.S. policymakers, diminishing Washingtons ability to prioritize long-term strategic competition with China. A protracted conflict would likely also sustain the deep freeze in U.S.-Russian relations, potentially jeopardizing cooperation between Washington and Moscow on issues of global importance, such as arms control.   A long war would also disrupt the global economy. The United States most important trading partners and allies in Europe would be the hardest hit, mainly because of higher energy prices. And, of course, the country that would suffer the mostin terms of lives lost, infrastructure destroyed, and economic devastationis Ukraine. Even a conflict that continues at a lower level of intensity would disrupt the economy and scare off investment, complicating the countrys economic recovery.   In an op-ed in The New York Times in May, Biden wrote that U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was intended to put the countrys leaders in in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. Quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he wrote that ultimately this war will only definitively end through diplomacy. Five months later, that diplomacy has yet to materializea fact for which Russia bears primary responsibility.   But the United States could be doing more to enable diplomacy.",0,-0.9275
"I always assume any kind of diplomacy that ever happens is usually behind the scenes and not out in the open. Almost every country likes to put out a ""strong"" public front. Not that I'm saying I think the US is currently involved in brokering any diplomacy talks between Ukraine and Russia behind the scenes. But you never really know what's been happening until well after the fact.",0,0.5296
"What makes this even more complicated is that Azerbaijan is *also* friends with Russia; unlike the partnership with Armenia, the Azeri relationship is bery lucrative (lots of energy trade and they buy Russian weapons too).   Kremlin probably still sees Armenia as a bit of a PITA-but-mandatory thing to take care of, like they did in the Soviet times. Generally because of the natural resources and better access to the Politburo, the Azerbaijani SSR got all it asked for, such as denying Nagorno-Karabakh's repeated bids to be reunited with Armenian SSR, and in the  @  @ s when things heated up, having the Red Army take *just* a little too long to intervene in local ethnic cleansings.

"TBH UK could maybe have made Brexit work (initially the numbers were somewhat positive), but a lot of the decisions since then have just led to a bit of a vicious cycle.

"Macron is far from the only person with these big ideas, he's just the one with the most power. But Germany hasn't really bought into them yet.

(Historically, on a lot of matters you could divide the EU to  @  ""teams"": pro-responsibility sharing South, led by France; pro-austerity North, led by Germany; and the mostly Eastern pro-America contrarians, sometimes led by UK. So essentially Macron's concern would be that Scholz is getting the pro-America states in his camp by giving up on e.g. some common defense initiatives. Although tbh there's a lot of money involved because any acquisition from outside the EU - such as Polish Abrams and K @ , or German F- @  @  - is a potentiall loss for the French defense industrial complex.)",0,0.5499

"Most nations would prefer to trade in their own currency and there might be some bilateral agreements to that regard. Not just within the SCO, but other nations too.  However, none of that means that the dollar hegemony will be or can be broken.  There are a whole host of issues, but I'll just point out two major ones.   First, the US is willing to run a trade deficit with a lot of countries. This means they can always get dollars for trade with other countries as well. You can have a dollar reserve.   China isn't willing to run a deficit. You will quickly run out of RMB. How do you get more?  Second, the dollar's value is on the open market. RMB's value is what China says it is. I don't see many nations wanting that deal.  The dollar is here to stay, unless we see some big geopolitical change.",0,-0.431
"Eh, smaller countries have been very diligent in exercising their veto powers. It's more that in order to get an idea through the EU, you have to get full buy-in from both France and Germany before it has a chance of getting anywhere; and most ideas that get anywhere start in a meeting room between French and Germany leaders.  E.g. the Netherlands just blocked Romania's and Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area for the millionth time, even though both now fulfill the formal criteria and France &amp; Germany have been begging for NL to accept.  Similarly, Bulgaria is holding up Albania's and North Macedonia's membership bids because it has extremely petty nationalist resentment against the latter, and France has had its diplomats work overtime mediating their dispute (NM only got to the current step of the process by agreeing to *erase its school history books of references to a Macedonian identity separate from Bulgaria before the  @  @  @  @ s Balkan war*).",0,-0.0404

"It's possible but unlikely imo.  &gt; Among the necessary reforms, the Chancellor suggested a ""gradual"" transition away from unanimity, a strict requirement that still applies to select areas of work, such as foreign policy and taxation, and that often bogs down collective action at the EU level.  Federalisation is a fairly meaningless gesture unless it leads to a unified armed forces and the ability to both tax and redistribute funds around the EU. For a number of reasons I think this is quite unlikely. Stronger EU armed forces can work well under a USA umbrella due America being the clear commanding power while the EU forces can operate within that framework. But I struggle to believe that the militaries of France/Germany/Poland/Italy/Spain could be placed under federal control at the EU level. And this is before getting to discussing how this would look after the potential ascension of Turkey and Ukraine etc.   Noone has been able to successfully unite/dominate Europe since the Roman Empire literally millennia ago. And the reality is that while the USA supports the strengthening of EU defense budgets I suspect if this occurred alongside real attempts at federation and control of that military, this could change quite quickly.

I'll completely ignore every country's point of view because I think federalization can done by negotiating and compromising.    I simply think they're waiting for the PiS (the ruling party in Poland) to lose the elections.

Not only would it prove Russian intel to be correct, but it would completely kill any further international supplies, intel, and support, leaving them completely on their own.   As for Russia? While you can never be completely certain, I highly doubt they would resort to using a dirty bomb for any false flag operation. Since using a dirty bomb to achieve escalatory goals would be an extraordinarily convoluted/complicated process that could potentially be done in better ways, Russia has been making up nonsense like this since the beginning of the war. With each of these accusations, nothing ever came from the fear of laying down false flag groundwork, either, such as:  June - Russian MoD announced that Ukraine was preparing to use chemical weapons in Odesa. This never happened.

"Hi,  So just asking  @  questions to further my understanding.  My first question is what is Putins rationale for the invasion?  I understand Putin has twisted history to suggest that Ukraine is an artificial country created by Russia. My understanding is there is a grain of truth in every lie and that it is true that historically both Ukrainians and Russians descend from the Kievan-Rus, but that they over time become distinct ethnic groups. My understanding is also that Russia has for the past few centuries been the imperial overlord over Ukraine, and so whilst Russians have at times considered Ukrainians as a subset of Russians, the Ukrainians have always held onto their national identity even when they havent had a state (a la the English and say the Welsh or Irish).  I find it really hard to believe that Putin really thought that Ukraine was run by Western controlled, Russophobic neo-nazis. Surely that was just his excuse towards the Russian people who I am sure are not naturally inclined to wage war against a nation they consider similar to themselves. Or maybe he did believe it.   Currently I feel that he does indeed believe they are western controlled even if not russophobic or neo nazi and that is his real reason for invading. My personal view is not that Ukraine is Western controlled but western leaning.  My second question is what are the wider factors that led to Russias invasion?  I used to think this war was all about NATO expansion, black and white, pure and simple. I found (and still find) Mearsheimers analysis compelling to a degree. Having said that I have listened to the analysis of those who think hes completely wrong and have often found them compelling that this is more a war of re-establishing a Russian Empire and could be the start of further Russian expansion.  I now think that there are probably several factors of which NATO expansion is a significant factor, but just one of many. However I think Putin is a man with imperialistic ambitions for Russia and that even if he were not to invade other countries immediately after Ukraine, he/leaders after him may do so once Russia gains the capabilities.  It seems to me that Russia due to its history and size is a paranoid nation, one that sees domination of its neighbours as the only means to ensure security. This then results in its neighbours feeling paranoid and then fuels NATO expansion eastwards, further fuelling Russian paranoia. Ontop of that the USA isnt exactly free from paranoia itself when it comes to Russia and has been hawkish at times when it neednt have been post soviet collapse.   This isnt to suggest that Russia is not to blame for the invasion, I think they are  @  @  @ % to blame. I am just seeking to understand to what extent all these factors (imperialistic ambition, security concerns due to NATO expansion, Putins personal vulnerability, perceived US weakness etc) have contributed to the current situation.  My last question is what is the likely end point?  I hear a lot of people say from a purely moralistic perspective that this ends once all Ukrainian territory is handed back, including Crimea.  I think this would be ideal but I dont think its likely. Im not even convinced that this is the USAs primary geopolitical objective in arming Ukraine but a secondary objective. It seems to me their primary objective is to weaken Russia. As such I assume that once weakening Russia is expending too many US resources for their liking they will encourage the Ukrainians to sit and talk.  I suspect this will end with the eastern annexed regions being handed back with autonomy, a  @  @ / @  @  possibility that Crimea is handed back with huge amounts of autonomy and a guarantee that Ukraine doesnt join the EU/NATO. I dont think that would be a definitive end to the conflict (which I see as taking decades to resolve) just the short term war. I just dont see how the conflict ends without Ukraine being able to maintain territorial integrity or without Russia being able to say at least they arent Western (although on this last point I think a neutral Ukraine wouldnt be very neutral at all).",0,-0.9567

The pipelines would follow be far cheaper and barges could be made that are far larger than those that would need to pass through the Panama Canal.

The deeper answer is that the federal government in power, the Liberals, do not want to empower oil - the support base does not live in these oil producing regions of Canada.  By reducing oil output (e.g. not building pipelines and LNG plants) the economic impact of the sector on the industrial base is limited, preventing the onset of Dutch disease.

"I'm Canadian.  The best option would be for heavy oil (bitumen) from Alberta to be refined in Canada (especially in Alberta or anywhere close to Fort Mac) and then the lighter fuels exported abroad.

A less appealing scenario (and probably not one that makes a lot of economic sense) would be to ship bitumen overseas.  There was a pipeline project proposed that would take product from the heavy-oil producing regions in northern Alberta (near Canada's west coast) and pipe it to the east (Atlantic) coast, where it would then be refined in New Brunswick and shipped abroad.  That project was cancelled by the lead proponent, TransCanada, in  @  @  @  @ .  A lot of people seem to think that Justin Trudeau cancelled that project.

But the good thing (for Canadians and especially for Albertans) is that any fossil fuel products that don't get extracted and used now will only become more valuable over time.

Biden and Schultz and other western world leaders are trying to manage how all this plays out. I'm not interested in defending any of their decisions.

The problem is primary evidence rarely tells you about religion (a stone temple foundation does not tell you the prayers that were said).

Finally, and least important, is comparative - later stuff that looks like it fits.   Most religious arguments I have, people flip the importance so comparative &gt; secondary &gt; primary.   This is the real picture: primary is the only one that counts. Secondary is what we use to try and make it make sense, but it is unreliable. Comparative is least important, by a long mile.

These past  @  days were just horrible, as they usually are after a new missile strike happens. Here in Kharkiv the situation is stable right now. Yesterday we lost electricity around  @ : @  @ pm, but it was restored pretty fast, some places already had it back up after a couple of hours, for us specifically it took until  @  @ pm, which is still very fast. By this morning the electricity was already restored everywhere in Kharkiv oblast, but there is still a big energy generation deficit in the system because Russians managed to hit  @  of our thermal power plants, so some cities will have longer blackouts for some time until those are fixed/rerouted.  While the electricity problems do suck, the missile strikes on civilians yesterday are much worse, and they hurt much more than sitting without electricity for a couple of hours. Its not something that would ever break our spirit or make us surrender, but seeing innocent civilians killed by the fucking Russian terrorists is just enraging.   And Russians were extremely happy when the news about apartment block in Dnipro being hit were released, they want more of it. It disgusts me that so many people defend Russians, saying they are innocent, while those innocent Russians gloat about our civilians being killed by missiles every single time it happens. How the fuck can you be happy about our civilians being killed and innocent at the same time? Ill never be able to understand that.",1,-0.9915

"The rich aren't always the most aware of how the world works. They hire other people who are pros at this or that to figure out the world for them. So, when they have all this wealth they can easily fail to realize it's not sustainable. Nobody tells them.  If you have tons of wealth in stock or even money in bonds, you don't see it and don't necessarily realize its influence/effects on the economy when considering at the bigger picture.  So they spend however they want, beyond a certain wealth level that's just a given and it doesn't change for even someone like Elon Musk after losing a ton of dough. Why would you think having more or less makes a difference when you don't see it? Someone needs to tell them and ELI @ .  That wealth is going into something. It doesn't just sit in a bank vault like Midas' pile of gold. It's involved in the economy. It touches things. It's especially true when things go sideways like the  @  @  @  @ / @  @  mortgage crisis caused by bad loans to home buyers or with the recent crypto market collapse. Why did that one happen? It was probably simple fraud, but it happened. The money lost went somewhere and that shift of wealth affects things.  I often complain about Reaganomics and how it said that Labor didn't ever deserve more of the nation's GDP because it was stagnant and only Capital could positively change the economy for the better, thus meaning only the super-rich with lots of Capital to invest deserve the new gains. That shift of wealth has led, at least in part, to this new situation. But, going forward the situation is not good.  Why did the rents go up suddenly? New money was pumped into properties and the greedy b****rds upped rents because they (thought) they could get away with it. Well, a housing price collapse is due and those who sold properties and got wads of cash are the winners. Buyers will bust and lose a bunch. Meanwhile, in the real world, renters will suffer from no bad behavior whatsoever. That's where this is a bad system.  Reaganomics needs to be rethought, though I like the markets being more open to people and lower tax rates (the WWII rates were no longer needed), and the way the Fed can handle interest rates and other things.
